# Business Problem
###########################

# Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service.
# You can easily access services such as cleaning, renovation, transportation with a few touches on your computer or smartphone.
# provides access.
# By using the data set containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.
# It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning.

###########################
# Data set
###########################
#The dataset consists of the services customers receive and the categories of these services.
# It contains the date and time information of each service received.

# UserId: Customer number
# ServiceId: Anonymized services belonging to each category. (Example: Upholstery washing service under the cleaning category)
# A ServiceId can be found under different categories and refers to different services under different categories.
# (Example: Service with CategoryId 7 and ServiceId 4 is honeycomb cleaning, while service with CategoryId 2 and ServiceId 4 is furniture assembly)
# CategoryId: Anonymized categories. (Example: Cleaning, transportation, renovation category)
# CreateDate: The date the service was purchased

# Step 3: The data set consists of the date and time the services are received, there is no basket definition (invoice, etc.).
# In order to apply Association Rule Learning, a basket (invoice, etc.) definition must be created.
# Here, the definition of basket is the services that each customer receives monthly. For example; A basket of 9_4, 46_4 services received by the customer with id 7256 in the 8th month of 2017;
# 9_4, 38_4 services received in the 10th month of 2017 represent another basket. Baskets must be identified with a unique ID.
# For this, we first create a new date variable that contains only the year and month. Set the UserID and the date variable you just created to "_"
#We combine it with and assign it to a new variable called ID.
